/*
    Explanation:

### 1\. The Parent's Prop Definition

When you write `<ChildInner color={this.state.childColor} ... />`, the `color` on the left is the **prop name**, and the `{this.state.childColor}` on the right is the **prop value**.

Think of this as `ParentComp` creating a new object with the key `color` and the value from its state.

### 2\. The Child's `props` Object

React takes this object and passes it to the `ChildInner` component's `constructor` as an argument named `props`.

So, inside `ChildInner`, the `props` object looks like this:

```
{
  color: "green", // or whatever the user typed
  name: "John"
}
```

This is why, in the `constructor`, you have to call `super(props)`: it passes this object up to the `React.Component` parent class, which correctly sets `this.props` on your `ChildInner` instance.

### 3\. Accessing the Prop

After the `constructor` runs, you can access the value of the prop anywhere within the `ChildInner` component using `this.props.color`.

For example, in the `render` method, this line:

`const txtStyle = { color: this.props.color }`

is retrieving the value of the `color` prop (`"green"` or the user's input) from the `props` object and using it to set the CSS color style for the `<span>` element.

### Visual Analogy

Think of the parent-child relationship like this:

  * **ParentComp** is a parent preparing a lunchbox for their child.
  * The **`props`** are the items in the lunchbox (e.g., `color`, `name`).
  * The **`<ChildInner ... />`** line is the parent giving the lunchbox to the child.
  * The **`ChildInner`** component is the child, who can open the lunchbox (`this.props`) and use the items inside (`this.props.color`).

The child doesn't know where the food came from or how it was madeâ€”it only knows what's in the lunchbox. Similarly, `ChildInner` doesn't know about `ParentComp`'s state; it only knows about the props it receives.
